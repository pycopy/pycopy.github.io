<h1>What's in the name?</h1>

<p>
Pycopy's name started as mundane "Pico Python" and went thru the following magic
transmogrifications:
</p>

<p align="center">
<b>Pico Python</b> &rarr; <b>PicoPy</b> &rarr; <b>PycoPy</b> &rarr; <b>Pycopy</b>
</p>

<p>
Rendered like this, some people want to see in the name something more
than the original "Pico Python". They see <strike style="color: grey">distant lands and exotic
cities</strike> something like "Copy of Python, with baggage removed".
If you are among these people, congratulations - you have a good imagination!
</p>

<p>
Pycopy is pronounced like "pico pie", though among the Pycopy community, there's
a growing faction of those who pronounce it like "pie-co-pie".
